# Security

Wiredoor is designed with security in mind from the ground up. It leverages **modern encryption**, **private networking**, 
and **fine-grained access control** to help you safely expose services from otherwise unreachable environments like private networks, 
LANs, IoT systems, or Kubernetes clusters.

This guide outlines how Wiredoor keeps your services secure and what practices you should follow to maintain a robust security posture.

---

## Core Security Architecture

- ✅ **VPN-based reverse tunneling** with [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)
- ✅ **End-to-end encrypted traffic** between the node and the Wiredoor server
- ✅ **NAT traversal** with no need to open inbound ports
- ✅ **TLS/SSL termination** using Let's Encrypt or self-signed certs
- ✅ **Access restriction** via CIDR/IP filters
- ✅ **No cloud vendor lock-in** — fully self-hosted and auditable
- ✅ **Crowdsec Integration** to block malicious IPs

## Threat Detection and Firewalling with CrowdSec

Wiredoor supports integration with CrowdSec, a collaborative intrusion prevention system that detects malicious behavior in real time based on log analysis.

When enabled, CrowdSec can:

- Detect abusive IPs by analyzing access logs from Wiredoor’s NGINX gateway
- Automatically block malicious traffic using the **CrowdSec firewall bouncer** at host level
- Enrich your security posture with community-sourced threat intelligence

## Token-Based Authentication

Each node (including CLI clients and gateways) uses a **unique access token** that identifies it and scopes its permissions.

### Best practices

- Store tokens securely (e.g., `config.ini`, Kubernetes Secrets).
- Never hardcode tokens into public repositories.
- Rotate tokens regularly using the `wiredoor regenerate` command.
- Revoke tokens immediately if a node is compromised or regenerate node config.

---

## Certificate Management

Wiredoor handles SSL certificates in two modes:

| Mode          | Description                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Let's Encrypt | Used when exposing services on a **valid public domain** |
| Self-signed   | Used for **internal domains** or IP-based access         |

### Tips

- Use valid DNS records (A or CNAME) pointing to your Wiredoor Server for public domains
- For production-grade services, always prefer Let's Encrypt over self-signed certs
- Certificate renewal is handled automatically by Wiredoor

## Access Control with IP Restrictions

When exposing a service, you can limit access by IP or CIDR block using the Web UI or CLI. It's important to note 
that the IP or CIDR block must be public since Wiredoor is designed to expose services to the internet.

```bash
wiredoor http dashboard --domain grafana.example.com --port 3000 --allow 192.168.100.0/24 --block 192.168.100.5/32
```

In this example, only clients from the 192.168.100.0/24 except 192.168.100.5 IP range will be able to access the service. 
Make sure to use public IP ranges that are valid and accessible from outside your private network.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Note: Restricting by private IPs or internal networks won't work, as the service is exposed to the public internet.

## Secure Node Types

**Normal Nodes**

- Only expose services from the local machine
- Ideal for standalone apps, dev servers, or small deployments

**Gateway Nodes**

- Can expose services from an entire subnet
- Must be scoped carefully with:
  - Subnet definitions (e.g. 10.96.0.0/12)
  - Network policies (if in Kubernetes)
  - IP filtering

## Kubernetes Gateway Security (Summary)

Wiredoor K8S Gateway (Helm chart) includes extra controls:

- Built-in **NetworkPolicy support** to restrict egress access
- Internal DNS resolution
- Does not require privileged mode
- Can be scoped to specific services via labels/namespaces

Example NetworkPolicy Helm config:

```yaml filename="values.yaml"
wiredoor:
  server: https://my-wiredoor.com
  token: your_gateway_token

networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  egress:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app.kubernetes.io/name: my-app
      namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: production
```

## Things to avoid

- Exposing services without authentication (e.g. admin panels)
- Reusing node tokens across multiple machines
- Running Wiredoor in public clouds without proper firewalling

## Summary

Wiredoor gives you full control over service exposure without compromising on security. 
Combined with best practices, firewall-level threat detection, and careful node management, it offers a strong, 
flexible, and private alternative to commercial ingress or tunneling platforms.
